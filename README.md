okta-microservice-docker

The "start" branch should really be "complete" branch, I inherited the branch name as I did git clone (check out the start branch) in the beginning. The proper step should be 
fork the repo, then start on my repo (branch).

Also on my Mac it seems I can only spin up the service and the config server due to memory limitation (docker seems are both CPU and memory hungry). I will attempt this on a 
higher horse power machine.
